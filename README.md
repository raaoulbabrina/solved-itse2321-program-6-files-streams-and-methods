The trustees of a small college are considering voting a pay raise for their faculty members.  They want to grant a 4 percent raise for those earning more than $70,000.00, a 7 percent raise for those earning more than $50,000.00 and 5.5 percent raise for all others. However before doing so, they want to know how much this will cost. Write a program that will print the pay raise for each faculty member, the total amount of the raises, and the average of the raises.  Also, print the total and average faculty payroll before and after the raise.  Use the end of file as a sentinel value.  The input data is available in <strong><em>Program6.txt</em>.</strong>




<strong>Do NOT use any logical operator in the program.  You will not receive credit for the program if you do. </strong>




<strong>No input, processing or output should happen in the main method</strong>.  <strong>All work should be delegated to other non-static methods</strong>.  The program should have at least<strong> 4 nonstatic methods </strong>(main and developerInfo not included) and the output sent to an output file, <strong><em>Program6-out.txt</em></strong>. Include the recommended minimum documentation for each method.  See the program one template for more details.
